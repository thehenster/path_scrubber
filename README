h1. PathScrubber

PathScrubber is a simple rails plugin (that can be used independently of rails) to clean up strings according to a customizable style. Its most obvious application is cleaning up paths to be SEO/URL friendly.

Dynamic methods are added to Ruby's native classes so your styles are always available when needed.

h2. Example

> PathScrubber::Scrubber.set_scrubber_style :url
=> true
> "Sam & John's predicatable post title!".scrub_as_url
=> "sam-and-johns-predicatable-post-title"

> PathScrubber::Scrubber.set_scrubber_style :scream, :upcase => true, :characters => {"." => "!"}
=> true
> ["Please move.", "To be continued..."].scrub_as_scream
=> ["PLEASE MOVE!", "TO BE CONTINUED!!!"]
